# How To Run
## iOS
> Select the legacy build from `File > Workspace settings`

## Android
> `react-native run-android` to boot on your simulator


# Scripts and installation dir
`dev-inst`: this script will install the repo as a module so that react-native can target the module and hot reload
`inst`: This script will re-install the repo

To use the installed repo you will have to swap out the module/index for `@paintrace/react-native-color-picker`
